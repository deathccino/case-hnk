    "## Case Description\n",
    "* The Ponta Grossa (PG) brewery produces many famous beer brands such as Heineken and Amstel.\n",
    "* The brewing process has two major phases, a hot phase, and a cold phase (Figure 1). During the hot phase,\n",
    "two types of malts are milled: a base malt which is light colored and comes in greater amounts and a\n",
    "roast malt, which has a darker color and therefore is used in giving beer its desired color.\n",
    "* These malts are sent to the malt cooker and cooked with water in the mashing step. The grains\n",
    "are then filtered in the lautering step after which the wort (liquid extracted from the mashing process)\n",
    "is boiled with hops. The used hop is then filtered in the whirlpool and the hot wort goes on to cool to be\n",
    "later fermented. Each production that goes through these phases is call a “batch”.\n",
    "* Several KPIs are monitored throughout this process. An important one that characterizes beer\n",
    "brands is color. Since Ponta Grossa (PG) brewery has an issue of color assertiveness during the brewing process\n",
    "they have decided to use data science tools to correct beer color index. Since it is empirical brewing\n",
    "knowledge that the hot phase of brewing is what most affects final beer color, PG has decided to\n",
    "implement an advanced analytics tool that predicts beer color right after the cooling process.\n",
    "* Based on the data available, fit a model to predict the color of the cold wort for the AMSTEL\n",
    "brand only."
